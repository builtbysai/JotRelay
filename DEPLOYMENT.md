# JotRelay — Deployment Guide

> ⚠️ **Personal / demo project.**  
> Room links are frontend-restricted, not backend-secret — anyone who knows or guesses a room's URL can view **and edit** it. `?mode=read` and `/share/:token` read-only links are a UI convention, not a hard server-side boundary (see [Security reminder](#security-reminder) below). The room lock feature is the one control that's actually server-enforced.  
> View-once is still a convenience feature, not a secure destruction guarantee. A viewer may copy, screenshot, save, or otherwise preserve content before it clears.  
> Do **not** deploy JotRelay for use with passwords, HIPAA/PII, classified data, or anything sensitive.

## Prerequisites

- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project (free tier works)
- A GitHub account with GitHub Pages enabled

---

## Base path

JotRelay is deployed on two hosts simultaneously, each with a different natural URL shape, from the exact same static files — no build step, no per-host variant:

- **GitHub Pages** (`builtbysai.github.io/JotRelay/`) — project-page hosting always prefixes the URL with the repo name.
- **Netlify** (`jotrelay.netlify.app/`, and eventually a custom domain) — serves at the literal root.

`index.html` detects which one it's on and adapts automatically, via a `<base>` element written by a tiny inline script right at the top of `<head>` (before any stylesheet/script tag is parsed):

```html
<script>
  document.write('<base id="app-base" href="' +
    ((location.pathname === '/JotRelay' || location.pathname.indexOf('/JotRelay/') === 0) ? '/JotRelay/' : '/') +
    '">');
</script>
```

This uses `document.write()` rather than a static `href="/"` corrected afterward via `setAttribute()` — the browser's preload scanner reads raw HTML bytes ahead of script execution and only sees `document.write()`'s synchronous output, not later DOM mutations, so a static-then-patched `<base>` let it speculatively (and wrongly) issue every stylesheet/module request against root on GitHub Pages before the real, correctly-based request re-fetched it.

Every asset `href`/`src` and internal `<a>` link in `index.html` is written as a **relative** path (no leading slash — e.g. `styles/base.css`, `app/`) so it resolves against whichever `<base>` ends up in effect. `window.SYNCPAD_CONFIG.basePath` (read by `src/app/state.js`'s `BASE` constant, which every JS-side route/link computation uses) runs the identical `location.pathname` check, so the JS layer and the browser's own `<base>` resolution always agree.

`manifest.json`'s `start_url`/`scope`/icon `src` use the same trick a different way: per the Web App Manifest spec, those are resolved relative to the manifest file's own URL, not the page's `<base>` — so `"start_url": "./"` and relative icon paths (`"assets/icon-192.png"`) correctly resolve to `/JotRelay/` or `/` on the two hosts without any per-host value at all.

The one thing that's genuinely per-host: `netlify.toml`'s catch-all SPA redirect (`/* → /index.html`, 200) — Netlify has no equivalent to GitHub Pages' automatic project-page routing, so a direct/refreshed visit to an in-app route (a room id, `/admin`, etc.) needs an explicit fallback rule, mirroring what `404.html`'s redirect script already does for GitHub Pages.

If a **third** host is ever added with yet another URL shape, extend the `<base>` script's condition (and `window.SYNCPAD_CONFIG.basePath`'s matching check) rather than hardcoding a new special case elsewhere — those two are the only places that need to agree.

---

## Step 1 — Supabase project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) → **New project**
2. Note your **Project URL** and **anon public key** from Settings → API
3. Optional: enable the `pg_cron` extension (Database → Extensions) for automatic expired-room cleanup

---

## Step 2 — Database and storage setup

### Brand-new project? Run one file.

**[`supabase/baseline.sql`](supabase/baseline.sql)** covers every *core* table, function, trigger, RLS policy, and Storage bucket/policy JotRelay uses — concatenated from most of the numbered migrations below into one script, now including `0010` through `0014`. Paste it into the Supabase **SQL Editor** and run it once; the app works after that — skip straight to [Step 3](#step-3--configure-credentials). One caveat worth knowing about before you rely on it: `0010`'s anonymous rate-limiting trigger depends on Supabase's edge network setting the `x-forwarded-for` header the way it assumes — see [Optional feature migrations](#optional-feature-migrations) below for the detail. If that assumption doesn't hold, effective abuse protection is much weaker than the advertised limits suggest, not just "somewhat reduced" — the remaining per-device limit is keyed on a plain client-supplied value with no server-side identity behind it, so a scripted caller can send a fresh one on every request and never trip it.

It's verified end-to-end, not just assembled by hand: run twice in a row against a real Postgres 16 server (stubbed with minimal `auth`/`storage` schemas standing in for the Supabase-platform pieces the SQL assumes exist) with zero errors either time, confirming the whole file — not just each section individually — is genuinely idempotent and safe to rerun. `0010`'s rate limiting was also exercised under genuine concurrency (40 simultaneous room-creation attempts from one identifier — exactly 30 succeeded, 10 were rejected, matching the advertised cap under real concurrent load, not just sequentially) and its admin-reset delete path was verified as an admin vs. a non-admin authenticated user, not assumed from the policy definition alone.

> **Important:** the Storage bucket it creates is private. JotRelay always accesses files via signed URLs. Do not make the bucket public.

The optional Storage cleanup Edge Function lives at `supabase/functions/syncpad-cleanup` and is deployed separately with the Supabase CLI — it is not part of `baseline.sql` or any SQL script.

### Existing project? Use the numbered migrations.

JotRelay's SQL also lives broken out in `supabase/migrations/`, one file per migration, numbered in the order they must be run — the standard layout for a project without a migration-tracking tool (and the same path the Supabase CLI would use, if this project ever adopts it). `baseline.sql` is generated from these; they stay the source of truth, each independently reviewable with its own git history. All of them are **idempotent** — safe to rerun on an existing project. Use these (not `baseline.sql`) to pick up something new on a database that's already running:

1. **[`supabase/migrations/0001_base_schema.sql`](supabase/migrations/0001_base_schema.sql)** — the base schema, and the only migration a brand-new project actually needs on its own. Creates:
   - `syncpad_rooms` and `syncpad_files` tables, indexes, Realtime publication entries
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies — `room_id` + the anon key is sufficient to read and write a room
   - `cleanup_expired_syncpad_rooms()` and an optional `pg_cron` schedule (every 10 minutes, skipped gracefully if pg_cron isn't enabled)
   - A trigger enforcing the room editing lock (`editing_locked`) at the database level — this is the one access control that's actually server-enforced
   - `syncpad-files` Storage bucket (private) + Storage RLS policies

If you previously deployed with the edit-token migrations (`0007_room_edit_tokens.sql`), also run **[`supabase/migrations/0009_revert_edit_token_write_gating.sql`](supabase/migrations/0009_revert_edit_token_write_gating.sql)** to restore normal write access — see that file's header for why the edit-token model was reverted. A fresh project that never ran `0007` doesn't need `0009` either (and `baseline.sql` excludes both — see its own header).

### Optional feature migrations

These genuinely are opt-in — the app works without them, and each feature just silently no-ops (or shows a "check Supabase setup" error) until its migration is run. `baseline.sql` includes `0002`–`0006`, `0008`, and `0010`–`0015` — the table below is for applying them individually to an **existing** project that hasn't run them yet (run `0001` first, then any of these you want, in any order). Two of these (`0013`, `0014`) are marked below as **not actually safe to skip** despite living in this "optional" table — the client unconditionally writes their column on every request regardless of whether the room uses the feature, so without the migration the request fails outright rather than the feature just being unavailable.

| Migration | Enables | Symptom if skipped |
|---|---|---|
| [`supabase/migrations/0002_short_room_codes.sql`](supabase/migrations/0002_short_room_codes.sql) | Short (6-character) spoken/typed room codes — the "Short code" row in the Share modal, and typing a code into the landing page's join box | Share modal shows "Short codes need one more setup step…"; typing a code on the landing page falls through to treating it as a literal room id instead of resolving it |
| [`supabase/migrations/0003_room_comments.sql`](supabase/migrations/0003_room_comments.sql) | Anchored inline comments on a text range (Comments panel) | Comments panel loads with no comments and no error — the feature is silently unavailable |
| [`supabase/migrations/0013_comment_anchor_text.sql`](supabase/migrations/0013_comment_anchor_text.sql) | Companion to `0003` — auto-deletes a comment when its anchored text is removed from the note. **Run this alongside `0003` on any existing project** — the client unconditionally reads/writes this column, so comments break entirely on a project that ran `0003` but not `0013` | Comments panel fails to load (`anchor_text` column doesn't exist) and adding a comment fails the same way |
| [`supabase/migrations/0004_version_history.sql`](supabase/migrations/0004_version_history.sql) | Version History panel — browse and restore past snapshots of a room | History panel shows no snapshots |
| [`supabase/migrations/0005_device_limit.sql`](supabase/migrations/0005_device_limit.sql) | "Burn after N devices join" room setting | The device-limit setting has no effect; `device_limit` stays `null` |
| [`supabase/migrations/0006_admin_dashboard_improvements.sql`](supabase/migrations/0006_admin_dashboard_improvements.sql) | Admin audit log, room quarantine, and disabled-downloads support in `/admin` | Those admin actions are unavailable; the rest of `/admin` still works |
| [`supabase/migrations/0008_quarantine_enforcement.sql`](supabase/migrations/0008_quarantine_enforcement.sql) | Server-enforced quarantine — a database trigger, same technique as room lock; requires `0006` first | Quarantine still works from `/admin`, but (as documented in `0006`'s own header) is frontend-only without this — a determined user could bypass it by calling the API directly |
| [`supabase/migrations/0007_room_edit_tokens.sql`](supabase/migrations/0007_room_edit_tokens.sql) | Historical/optional — the edit-token table and RPCs, unused by the current client (see `0009`'s header). Only relevant if you want to build something else on top of it | Nothing — this is inert infrastructure, not a live feature |
| [`supabase/migrations/0010_anonymous_write_rate_limiting.sql`](supabase/migrations/0010_anonymous_write_rate_limiting.sql) | Server-side rate limiting on anonymous room creation (30/device + 60/IP per 15 min) and report submission (10/device + 20/IP per 15 min) — a `BEFORE INSERT` trigger, same technique as the lock/quarantine triggers. The per-device/IP counting logic itself is verified directly (30 inserts succeed, the 31st is rejected, tested against a real Postgres instance). The one still-open question is narrower: whether *this* project's PostgREST layer actually populates `x-forwarded-for` the way `syncpad_client_ip()` reads it — `select public.syncpad_client_ip()` from the SQL Editor is a quick way to check (it'll return `null` there regardless, since the SQL Editor isn't a PostgREST request; check via real anonymous traffic instead). If it doesn't, IP-based limiting silently no-ops — and since `created_by_device`/`reporter_device_id` are plain, unvalidated client-supplied values (see the migration's own header) with no server-side identity behind them, a determined scripted caller can defeat the remaining device-based limit for free by sending a fresh one on every request. Effective abuse protection genuinely depends on IP extraction working, not just a modest reduction in coverage | No rate limiting on room creation or report submission beyond whatever Supabase's own platform-level limits provide |
| [`supabase/migrations/0011_short_file_references.sql`](supabase/migrations/0011_short_file_references.sql) | Short, sequential-per-room file references (`syncpad-file:3` instead of the full storage path) so inserted file links stay human-typeable; safe to rerun, and legacy long-form references keep resolving unchanged | New file references still embed the full storage path — longer links, but nothing breaks |
| [`supabase/migrations/0012_admin_sort_indexes.sql`](supabase/migrations/0012_admin_sort_indexes.sql) | Indexes on `syncpad_rooms.updated_at`/`created_at` and `syncpad_files.uploaded_at` — the columns the admin dashboard's Rooms/Files tabs actually sort and range-filter by | Nothing breaks — those admin queries just fall back to a full table scan + in-memory sort, which scales with total room/file count instead of the page size actually requested |
| [`supabase/migrations/0014_file_encryption.sql`](supabase/migrations/0014_file_encryption.sql) | Client-side AES-256-GCM encryption of a file's *content* on upload to an encrypted room (same key as note text) — lifts the earlier restriction that blocked file uploads outright while a room was encrypted. **Run this on any existing project before deploying an updated client** — `uploadFile()` unconditionally writes `syncpad_files.encrypted` on every insert now, encrypted room or not, so without this column present the insert fails and **all** file uploads break, not just encrypted-room ones | Every file upload fails (`syncpad_files.encrypted` column doesn't exist) |
| [`supabase/migrations/0015_timed_reveal.sql`](supabase/migrations/0015_timed_reveal.sql) | Timed Reveal room setting — hides content from everyone but the room's creator until a set future time | The "Timed reveal" row in Settings → Room Controls shows an error toast when set; `reveal_at` stays `null` |

If a feature you expect to see doesn't work, re-check that its migration was actually run — the Supabase SQL Editor's query history shows past runs.

---

## Step 3 — Configure credentials

Open `index.html` and replace the placeholder credentials:

```html
<script>
  window.SYNCPAD_CONFIG = {
    supabaseUrl:     'https://YOUR-PROJECT-REF.supabase.co',
    supabaseAnonKey: 'YOUR-ANON-PUBLIC-KEY',
  };
</script>
```

The anon key is public-facing by design in Supabase. RLS policies (installed by `supabase/migrations/0001_base_schema.sql`) control what the anon role can actually do.

---

## Step 4 — Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Push the repository to GitHub (the entire project root, no build needed)
2. **Settings → Pages → Source:** Deploy from a branch → `main` → `/` (root)
3. GitHub deploys to `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/JotRelay/`

The `404.html` file handles SPA routing: unknown paths store the room ID in `sessionStorage`, then redirect to the app root so the correct room loads.

### Alternative hosting

JotRelay deploys to any static host — Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, or any CDN. No server-side logic is needed. Just set the publish directory to the repo root and configure the rewrite rule to serve `index.html` for all paths. Then update the configured base path and static asset prefixes as described above.

---

## Step 5 — Verify deployment

After deploying, confirm these work in a browser:

- [ ] Landing screen loads at the root URL
- [ ] Creating a room redirects to `/<roomId>`
- [ ] Joining a room by URL works
- [ ] Hard-refreshing a room URL loads correctly (404.html redirect)
- [ ] Read-only share link (`/JotRelay/share/:token`) opens in read-only mode
- [ ] Uploading a file works
- [ ] Downloading a file works
- [ ] Two browser tabs show each other in the Devices panel
- [ ] Typing in one tab shows the indicator in the other

---

## Scheduled cleanup

### Expired rooms (Postgres-side)

If `pg_cron` is enabled, the SQL setup schedules a job every 10 minutes:

```sql
-- Verify the job exists
SELECT jobid, jobname, schedule, active
FROM   cron.job
WHERE  jobname = 'syncpad-expired-room-cleanup';

-- Run manually at any time
SELECT * FROM public.cleanup_expired_syncpad_rooms();
```

Unencrypted expired rooms are cleared in place. Encrypted expired rooms are deleted (the DB cannot recreate the encrypted empty payload without the user's passphrase).

### Rate-limit log (Postgres-side, if `0010` is applied)

`0010_anonymous_write_rate_limiting.sql` only needs the last 15 minutes of activity to enforce its limits, but every successful room creation and report insert leaves a row (including an IP address, if one was captured) — nothing prunes that table without `pg_cron`. If `pg_cron` is enabled, the same setup schedules a cleanup job every 30 minutes, same pattern as expired-room cleanup above:

```sql
-- Verify the job exists
SELECT jobid, jobname, schedule, active
FROM   cron.job
WHERE  jobname = 'syncpad-rate-limit-log-cleanup';

-- Run manually at any time (safe with or without pg_cron)
SELECT public.cleanup_syncpad_rate_limit_log();
```

Without `pg_cron`, run the manual query above periodically yourself (a cron job hitting the SQL Editor's API, or just doing it by hand occasionally) — otherwise the table grows unbounded and accumulates IP addresses indefinitely, which is worth avoiding even though nothing else in the app reads or exposes this table.

### Storage orphan cleanup

Deleting a `syncpad_rooms` row cascades the `syncpad_files` metadata rows via `ON DELETE CASCADE`. It does **not** remove the physical objects in the `syncpad-files` Storage bucket unless the deletion path explicitly calls the Storage API.

The admin UI now removes known Storage objects before deleting rooms. For backend cleanup paths, deploy the optional service-role Edge Function:

```bash
# From a machine with the Supabase CLI configured for this project
supabase secrets set SYNCPAD_CLEANUP_SECRET="use-a-long-random-value"
supabase functions deploy syncpad-cleanup --no-verify-jwt

# Dry run first
curl -X POST "https://YOUR-PROJECT-REF.functions.supabase.co/syncpad-cleanup" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SYNCPAD_CLEANUP_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mode":"all","dryRun":true}'

# Real cleanup after reviewing counts
curl -X POST "https://YOUR-PROJECT-REF.functions.supabase.co/syncpad-cleanup" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SYNCPAD_CLEANUP_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mode":"all","dryRun":false}'
```

Supported modes are `expired`, `orphans`, and `all`. The function logs aggregate counts only and never reads file contents. Keep `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` server-side only; never add it to `index.html`.

For manual auditing, list known metadata paths:

```sql
SELECT room_id, file_path, filename, file_size
FROM   syncpad_files
ORDER  BY room_id, uploaded_at;
```

Then compare those paths with Supabase Dashboard -> Storage -> `syncpad-files`. Delete only confirmed orphaned objects.

> Always verify before deleting. There is no undo for deleted storage objects.

## Web3Forms operations (Contact page)

JotRelay's contact form uses Web3Forms from frontend JavaScript. The Web3Forms access key is a **public frontend key**, not a server secret.

Recommended Web3Forms dashboard settings:

- **Allowed domain:** `builtbysai.github.io`
- **Subject:** `New JotRelay Contact Form Submission`
- **from_name:** `JotRelay Contact Form`
- **hCaptcha:** keep **off** unless the frontend adds an hCaptcha widget and verification flow

Operational note: keep the botcheck honeypot enabled and verify report-table DB constraints (reason allowlist + details length) and RLS posture before each public release.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Blank page on load | Wrong base path | Check `window.SYNCPAD_CONFIG.basePath`, static asset prefixes, and service worker scope |
| "Could not load room" | Wrong Supabase credentials | Check `supabaseUrl` and `supabaseAnonKey` in `index.html` |
| Files not uploading | Storage bucket missing or wrong RLS | Re-run `supabase/migrations/0001_base_schema.sql`; verify bucket policies |
| Realtime not syncing | Supabase Realtime not enabled | Dashboard → Database → Replication → enable both tables |
| Expired rooms not cleared | `pg_cron` not enabled | Enable `pg_cron` extension; re-run `supabase/migrations/0001_base_schema.sql` |
| App serving old cached content | Stale service worker | Bump `CACHE_VERSION` in `service-worker.js`; redeploy |
| Room URL 404 on hard refresh | `404.html` not present | Ensure `404.html` is in the repo root and deployed |
| Mobile "Add to Home Screen" fails | Wrong manifest paths | Verify `/JotRelay/` prefix in `manifest.json` icons |
| Room creation fails after visiting `/admin` | Missing authenticated RLS policies | Re-run `supabase/migrations/0001_base_schema.sql` — the authenticated baseline policies section fixes this |

---

## Service worker cache versioning

The service worker uses a named cache. To force clients to download fresh assets after cached files change:

1. Bump `CACHE_VERSION` in `service-worker.js`
2. Deploy
3. On next load, old caches are purged and fresh assets are fetched

Check `service-worker.js` directly for the current value rather than trusting a number written here — it changes with nearly every release and this doc doesn't get updated in lockstep.

---

## Security reminder

| Control | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| Read-only links (`?mode=read`, `/share/:token`) | **Frontend-only** — a UI/UX convention, not a server boundary. `room_id` + the anon key is sufficient to write regardless of which link was used; a read-only viewer necessarily learns `room_id` from viewing the room's content, so a technical visitor could call the write path directly. Use room lock for an actual guarantee |
| Room lock | **Backend-enforced** — a database trigger (`syncpad_rooms_enforce_lock`, installed by `supabase/migrations/0001_base_schema.sql`) rejects content changes to a locked room regardless of what calls the API |
| Room quarantine (optional, `/admin`) | **Backend-enforced** if `0008_quarantine_enforcement.sql` is applied — same trigger technique as room lock; frontend-only otherwise (see `0006`'s header) |
| `/admin` route | Supabase Auth (`signInWithPassword`) + `is_syncpad_admin()` RLS — not a public-facing feature |
| Passcode | Client-side hash check |
| Timed reveal | **Frontend-only** — a pure client-side comparison against `reveal_at`; a technical visitor querying the REST API directly still sees content before the reveal time |
| Text encryption | In-browser (AES-256-GCM) |
| File access | Signed URLs (1 h TTL) — no end-to-end encryption |

Room links, passcode hashes, and file signed URLs are all controls a determined user with the anon key can get around on their own terms (see `docs/security.md`'s Known Limitations). Do not use JotRelay for sensitive data regardless — room lock is the only hard guarantee this app makes.

### Admin session and RLS roles

The Supabase JS client uses a single shared instance. After a user signs in at `/admin`, the client's session role changes from `anon` to `authenticated`. This means the anon RLS policies for `syncpad_rooms`, `syncpad_files`, and `storage.objects` no longer apply — they only match the `anon` role.

To prevent normal app features from breaking after admin login, `supabase/migrations/0001_base_schema.sql` adds mirrored **authenticated baseline** policies for all three that grant the same permissions as the anon policies. These are not privileged — they only allow what anon already could do. Admin-only destructive actions (delete rooms, etc.) are still gated by `is_syncpad_admin()` in separate admin policies.
